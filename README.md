# Analysis of High blood pressure with traditional statistic method






High blood pressure is prevalent no matter in developing or developed country. 

It is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated

. Although high blood pressure does not have significant symptoms, long term high blood pressure 

will cause severe problems including stroke, heart failure and kidney disease. 

Our analysis is important because we will find the exact probability change when we increase one 

unit in weight, age or height. More importantly, we will find the influence of smoking according 

to whether they have smoked and whether they smoked over 100 cigarettes by fitting a logistic regression. 

We selected the data from National Health and Nutrition Survey in which 16 variables are included.

Among these variables, we choose whether people having high blood pressure or not (HBP) to be our response

variable to study the risk factors of high blood pressure. The dataset also contains the information about

subjectsâ€™ age, sex, race, weight, height, serum cholesterol, whether one has smoked over 100 cigarettes

in their life and whether one smoking now.
